# Solar-Radiation-Absorption

This project simulates and explains how different concentrations of carbon dioxide affect the solar radiation absorption by the earth

Graphs include:
    1) Brightness dependence on frequency
    2) Brightness dependeence on wavelength
    3) Earth's atmospheric pressure dependence on altitude
    4) Air number density dependence on altitude
    5) Cross sections for carbon dioxide bending and asymmetric stretching modes
    6) Light absorption cross-section of carbon dioxide bending vibrational mode
    7) Light absorption cross-section of carbon dioxide asymmetric vibrational mode
    8) Explanation of solar radiation incident on earth
    9) Surface solar flux dependence on frequency
    10) Solar flux dependence on altitude
    
A Matlab code which produces all the above is provided.
